1. What is Spring FW and uses | Stand-alone vs Web vs Distributed applications

2. What is Spring Boot and uses

3. Spring vs Spring Boot

4. Web application development w.r.to Spring and Spring boot [DS VR cofiguration..etc]

5. Advantages of Spring Boot (Starter POMs, Auto config, Embedded servers & DB, Actuators, Rapid application development)

6. Disadvantages of Spring Boot (Migration from Spring to Spring boot)

7. Spring boot application structure 
	src/main/java
	src/main/test
	src/main/resources
	target
	pom.xml

8. Application.java or start class or Entrypoint class
	@SpringBootApplication = combination of @SpringBootConfiguration 
							+
						@EnableAutoConfiguration
							+
						@ComponentScan
	SpringApplication.run() use (Bootstrap process/Application starts from here)
		1) figuring out type of application (stand-alone/web/reactive-web)
		2) Initializers, Listeners loading
		3) Stopwatch & Banner configuration
		4) Application Context creation based on application type	
		5) Prepares context -> loads beans in application	
		6) Calling Runners
		7) ConfigurableApplicationContext will be returned by run()

9)ComponentScanning (@Component) and Base package convention (where Application/Entrypoint class avaialable)
	Sterio Type annotations: @Component, @Controller, @RestController, @Service, @Repository

10) Explicit Component Scanning -> [ @ComponentScan(basePackages = { "com.ashokit", "in.ashokit", "" }) ]

11) Spring Bean (life-cycle managed by IOC container) & How to make a class as Spring Bean
	[@Component, 
	 	@Controller, @RestController, 
		@Service, @Repository,
	 @Configuration(class level), 
	 @Bean(method level) --> to provide our own obj creation logic to IOC]
		@Configuration vs @Bean annotation

12) Component scanning order -> a) Base Package scanning 
				b) Sub-packages (of base package) scanning
				c) @Bean annotated methods get called in the end

13) Dependency Injection

14) @autowired (At Constructor level/Constructor Injection, At Setter level/Setter Injection, At Field level/Field Injection - Not recommended why?) s-16
